        <p>Release Date: 8/1/2025</p>
        <p> It's Flappy Bird, but much more fun and challenging! Rack up as many points as you can by going through pipes and collecting power-ups & fruit! Avoid the flying bullets and don't hit the pipes! Keep on flying and don't stop at nothing!</p>

      <div class="cream-box">
          <p>Controls: Z key to jump, X key to shoot seed pellets (if acquired), the up and down keys to make a selection, the shift key to pause/reset, the enter key to start game/unpause/save value, and the number keys to enter numerical values (Arcade Mode). 
            (You may also use the S or L keys to play in full screen.)</p>

          <p>Side Note: There are two modes featured in this game, Regular Mode and Arcade Mode. If you select the latter mode in the Options menu, you will be able to customize your own changes to the game (Ex. speed changes, volume changes, score value changes). This mode can be compatible with a custom arcade machine with proper button mappings. (It is advised to use the sound test before putting the game into service.) </p>
